## How to sign up

To register for links.dev, you need to do two things:

- Create **a pull request** to add yourself to the registry.yaml file. 
- Create **a new public repository** called "my-links". (You can also fork [this](https://github.com/fatih-yavuz/my-links)) This repository should contain two files:
  1. page.json, which contains the content of your page.
  2. [Optional] custom.css, which allows you to customize the look of your page.

That's it!
Once you have created your "my-links" repository and opened your pull request, wait for it to be reviewed and approved. Once it is merged to the master branch, your page will be visible at: https://links.dev/username

## Tips

### Profile Picture Tips
- Use and image url which has 1:1 aspect ratio for your profile picture. This will make sure that your profile picture is displayed correctly.
- You can use your Twitter or LinkedIn profile picture image url as your profile picture.
- Do not use a url which contains the image in a web page. This will not work. You need to use the direct image url (which most probably will have .jpg or .png extension). You can get this url by right clicking on the image and selecting "Copy image address".

### Available Icons
- You can use any of the icons listed [here](https://github.com/fatih-yavuz/links.dev/tree/main/user-page/icons)
- If you are a designer, feel free to create a pull request to add more icons to the list.


### Required page.json sections
To display your website, your `page.json` must have at least these sections:
- Name (`name`)
- Description (`description`)
- Your image URL (`image_url`)
- Collection of links (`links`)

The minimal version `page.json` file may looks like this:

```
{
  "name": "Your name",
  "description": "Your description",
  "image_url": "url_to_your_image",
  "links": [
    {
      "title": "Link title",
      "url": "link_url"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Your username must be unique. If your username is already taken, you will be asked to choose a different one.
- Your page cannot contain any offensive content.
- Your page cannot contain any links to illegal content.

## Frequently Asked Questions
#### My PR is merged but my page is online yet
You should invalidate the registry cache. Normally, it should be done automatically on the CI but sometimes, GitHub's own cache is not invalidated when links.dev's registry cache is invalidated. Click this link to invalidate registry cache. 
https://links.dev/fatih/?refresh-registry=1
#### I've updated my-links, but I don't see the update on my page
You need to clear the cache with hitting your page refresh=1 query param. 
Example: https://links.dev/fatih?refresh=1
If you still don't see the update, it might be because you recently committed the changes to your repo. It takes a bit time for GitHub to invalidate raw content caches. Try hitting your page with refresh=1 5 minutes later. 

#### Everything seems correct but there is a problem
- Check your my-links repo's branch. Make sure that it has a branch called "main" and it has relevant files.
 

#### Can I add myself to example-pages.js? 
It depends. If you have a different theme than the default one, yes you can. Please keep in mind that, you have to have a known image hosting provider url or Twitter, LinkedIn profile picture url. Because its content is displayed on the home page, and it is susceptible to XSS. That's why I cannot accept your pull request if you are using a custom image url.
