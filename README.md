## How to sign up

To register for links.dev, you need to do two things:

- Create a pull request to add yourself ([Example PR](https://github.com/fatih-yavuz/links.dev/pull/2))
  1. To the registry.yaml file.
  2. To the README.md file.
  3. To the early-adopters.js file (This will add you to the homepage of the site).
- Create a new public repository called "my-links". (You can also fork [this](https://github.com/fatih-yavuz/my-links)) This repository should contain two files:
  1. page.json, which contains the content of your page. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/fatih-yavuz/my-links/blob/main/page.json)
  2. [Optional] custom.css, which allows you to customize the look of your page. An example file can be found [here](https://github.com/fatih-yavuz/my-links/blob/main/custom.css). If you don't add this file, your theme will be the default.
- Once you have created your "my-links" repository and opened your pull request, wait for it to be reviewed and approved. Once it is merged to the master branch, your page will be visible at: https://links.dev/username (If you are an early adopter, please update README.md's Early Adopters section to include your name in your PR)

### Profile Picture Tips
- Use and image url which has 1:1 aspect ratio for your profile picture. This will make sure that your profile picture is displayed correctly.
- You can use your Twitter or LinkedIn profile picture image url as your profile picture.
- Do not use a url which contains the image in a web page. This will not work. You need to use the direct image url (which most probably will have .jpg or .png extension). You can get this url by right clicking on the image and selecting "Copy image address".

### Available Icons
- You can use any of the icons listed [here](https://github.com/fatih-yavuz/links.dev/tree/main/user-page/icons)
- If you are a designer, feel free to create a pull request to add more icons to the list.
