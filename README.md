## How to sign up

To register for links.dev, you need to do two things:

- Create a pull request to add yourself ([Example PR](https://github.com/fatih-yavuz/links.dev/pull/2))
  1. To the registry.yaml file.
  2. To the README.md file.
  3. To the early-adopters.js file (This will add you to the homepage of the site).
- Create a new public repository called "my-links". (You can also fork [this](https://github.com/fatih-yavuz/my-links)) This repository should contain two files:
  1. page.json, which contains the content of your page. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/fatih-yavuz/my-links/blob/main/page.json)
  2. [Optional] custom.css, which allows you to customize the look of your page. An example file can be found [here](https://github.com/fatih-yavuz/my-links/blob/main/custom.css). If you don't add this file, your theme will be the default.
- Once you have created your "my-links" repository and opened your pull request, wait for it to be reviewed and approved. Once it is merged to the master branch, your page will be visible at: https://links.dev/username (If you are an early adopter, please update README.md's Early Adopters section to include your name in your PR)
